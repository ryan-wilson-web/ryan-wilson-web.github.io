<span id="first-word">"Kevin</span> is <span>personable, enthusiastic, organized</span>, and <span>interacts excellently</span> with the students. His handouts were <span>clear and professional</span>, and his approach to the topics was both <span>fresh</span> and <span>valuable</span>. Both the students and the more experienced helpers we had on hand <span>agreed</span>.  At the conclusion of both seminars, evaluations were passed out. His students responded with <span>96% “excellent” and 4% “very good”</span>. (“Good”, “Fair”, and “Poor” were available but not selected.)"

<span>"Kevin Wilson</span> recently presented a half-day seminar at the Asheville, NC Bridge Room.  The evaluations were <span>overwhelmingly positive</span> with <span>86% rating it excellent and 14% rating it very good</span>, the two <span>highest possible</span> ratings.  The only suggestion for improvement was to <span>make the sessions longer</span>.  Kevin has an engaging style, an <span>encyclopedic knowledge of Bridge</span>, and <span>outstanding communication skills</span>.  We will definitely have him back!"

 "If you prefer meek opponents who never get in the way of your nice, orderly auctions, don't invite Kevin to come and speak to your Bridge group.  However, if you <span>ARE</span> the opponents, and would enjoy being a <span>feisty, pesky</span>, and <span>more talented opponent</span> to everyone including your closest bridge friends, <span>sign up as soon as you possibly can</span> for one of <span>Kevin's seminars</span>.

<p>
He will <span>change the level of your play</span> in <span>one afternoon - guaranteed.</span> I know because I've been on the receiving end from my own Bridge Group!"

Our club was <span>especially pleased</span> with the seminar conducted by Kevin.  It was our first such event, and members were somewhat skeptical.  The instruction was <span>clear</span> and <span>reinforced</span> by the play of the hands.  By the end, <span>everyone was excited</span> and were <span>immediately</span> asking when we could bring him back for another event.  It was <span>effortless</span> to coordinate with Kevin's wife Jennifer.  We will have him back!

"I am a bridge teacher and author myself and I tell my students “If you get a chance to hear Kevin speak, do it. He is the best teacher I have ever heard”.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A good Bridge Pro should have ample amounts of skill and knowledge.  A Bridge presenter should have a comfortable presence in front of an audience, have enough humor and casualness to put the audience at ease, enough experience to answer any question, and enough knowledge to have a multitude of topics to offer. A great presenter can do all that for any type of audience.  I have seen several of Kevin Wilson’s presentations and have <span>ALWAYS</span> come away super-satisfied that I just gained a wealth of new knowledge (even when I thought I already knew the topic)."
